# Artnet management tool
An Artnet device management tool written in Qt

Features:
 - Discovers and lists devices on network
 - Shows status information for detected nodes
 - Test a node by controlling it directly with sliders
 
Written as an exercise in QT. Contains a lot of bugs and can probably be written in a much better way!
